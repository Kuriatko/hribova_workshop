1	I've paid my dues
2	Time after time
3	I've done my sentence
4	But committed no crime
5	And bad mistakes 
6	I've made a few
7	I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
8	But I've come through
9	We are the champions, my friends
10	And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
11	We are the champions
12	We are the champions
13	No time for losers
14	'Cause we are the champions of the world
15	I've taken my bows
16	And my curtain calls
17	You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
18	I thank you all
19	But it's been no bed of roses
20	No pleasure cruise
21	I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
22	And I ain't gonna lose
23	We are the champions, my friends
24	And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
25	We are the champions
26	We are the champions
27	No time for losers
28	'Cause we are the champions of the world
29	We are the champions, my friends
30	And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
31	We are the champions
32	We are the champions
33	No time for losers
34	'Cause we are the champions
